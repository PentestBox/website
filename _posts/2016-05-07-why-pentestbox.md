This might be the first question in your mind when you visited PentestBox.com, and it is really natural for users to keep using the same thing in which they are comfortable. I completely stand by that thought. But i can list out some reasons which might make you consider using PentestBox once.

 For the rest of the Blogpost i will refer PentestBox as ptb, ptb is what i normally call it in dicussions, sounds much better right :) 

First of all, let me define ptb. According to official statment,"PentestBox is an Opensource PreConfigured Portable Penetration Testing Environment for Windows Operating System". what's that ? Okay, let me say in simple words, it let you run all your security tools direclty on windows operating system .

Really ? Yeah.

That sound's cool isn't. There are too many blogpost/videos on porting some or the other tool on windows, because generally a normal user run limited number of tools and he/she wants to run them directly on their operating system. And majority of computers users in world uses windows, around 80%.

Okay now coming to point. Why PentestBox ?

I will try not be biased when i compare Ptb with other pentesting distros, but let me know if i am.

Let me start by giving a very simple example. Suppose you have a windows machine and you want to watch a video, if i give you two options

1) Download a XYZ video player, run it direclty on your windows machine and Enjoy.
2) Install virtualbox or other virtualization software, download XYZ video player and then watch that video inside that virtual machine. 

I guess you would choose thr first option, because of very simple reasons

i) You RAM will not be unncessarily wasted. In case of a virtual machine, it requires atleast 2 GB of RAM. 
ii) Your hard disk space will not be wasted. In case of a virtual machine at least 10 GB of harddisk space is required.
iii) It make more sense then the other option.

Well i guess you would be able to co-relate between the above given example and pentestbox.

Let us ask some questions now.

* How many tools do ptb have ? I guess quality matters than the quantity, but still ptb have support for over 200 pentesting tools. 
* How tools are managed in ptb? Tools are directly fetched from their github repositories, so i do not have any control over their code. 
* Is it really efficient? As explained above, as ptb directly runs on your windows machine, it required very less resources, to be precise only 20MB of RAM, after starting usage depends on the tool you will be using.
* Can i add/delete tools ? Yeah, it is completely modular. Check this link to know more about it.
* How do i trust you, you might have backdoor or malware in it ? Well you should not, i will never say to trust me. That is why entire Framework and fuctioning of PentestBox is opensource. We do not hide anything. You can find our github repo at Github.com/PentestBox and more about architecture at docs.pentestbox.com
